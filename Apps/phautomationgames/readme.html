    <h3>Welcome to the Automation Games!</h3>
    <p>
        Your objective during the games is to keep up with incoming questions from the on-poll event of the Automation Games App.
        The app is going to generate new questions each minute with increasing difficulty via "question classes". Your task is to
        identify a question class and write a playbook that solves the problem and performs a `post answer` back to the API.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each question class may have a few varients so it is important to look at them closely as you develop your playbook and account
        for any variations within the question that might inform your playbook design. Ultimately you want to go "hands free" mode so that
        you and your team can move on to other questions whilst your playbooks keep racking up the points.
